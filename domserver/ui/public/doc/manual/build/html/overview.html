<h1>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>DOMjudge is a system for running programming contests, like the ICPC
regional and world finals programming contests.</p>
<p>This usually means that teams are on-site and have a fixed time period (mostly
5 hours) and one computer to solve a number of problems (mostly 8-12). Problems
are solved by writing a program in one of the allowed languages, that reads
input according to the problem input specification and writes the correct,
corresponding output.</p>
<p>The judging is done by submitting the source code of the solution to the jury.
There the jury system automatically compiles and runs the program and compares
the program output with the expected output.</p>
<p>This software can be used to handle the submission and judging during such
contests. It also handles feedback to the teams and communication on problems
(clarification requests). It has web interfaces for the jury, the teams (their
submissions and clarification requests) and the public (scoreboard).</p>
<section id="features">
<h2>Features<a class="headerlink" href="#features" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>A global overview of the features that DOMjudge provides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Automatic judging with distributed (scalable) judge hosts</p></li>
<li><p>Web interface for portability and simplicity</p></li>
<li><p>Modular system for plugging in languages/compilers and validators</p></li>
<li><p>Detailed jury information (submissions, judgings, diffs)
and options (rejudge, clarifications, resubmit)</p></li>
<li><p>Designed with security in mind</p></li>
</ul>
<p>DOMjudge has been used in many live contests
(see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.domjudge.org/about">https://www.domjudge.org/about</a> for an overview) and
is Open Source, Free Software.</p>

<section id="requirements-and-contest-planning">
<h2>Requirements and contest planning<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements-and-contest-planning" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>DOMjudge requires the following to be available to run. Please refer to the
<a class="reference internal" href="install-domserver.html"><span class="doc">DOMserver</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="install-judgehost.html"><span class="doc">Judgehost</span></a>
chapters for detailed software requirements.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>At least one machine to act as the <em>DOMjudge server</em> (or <em>domserver</em> for
brevity). The machine needs to be running Linux (or possibly a Unix
variant) and a webserver with PHP 7.4.0 or newer. A MySQL or MariaDB
database is also needed.</p></li>
<li><p>A number of machines to act as <em>judgehosts</em> (at least one). They need to run
Linux with (sudo) root access. Required software is the PHP commandline
client and compilers for the languages you want to support.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Team workstations</em>, one for each team. They require only a modern
web browser to interface with DOMjudge, but of course need a local
development environment for teams to develop and test solutions. Optionally
these have the DOMjudge submit client installed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Jury / admin workstations</em>. The jury members (persons) that want to
configure and monitor the contest need just any workstation with a web
browser to access the web interface. No DOMjudge software runs on these
machines.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One (virtual) machine is required to run the DOMserver. The minimum amount of
judgehosts is also one, but preferably more: depending on configured timelimits,
and the amount of testcases per problem, judging one solution can tie up a
judgehost for several minutes, and if there’s a problem with one judgehost it
can be resolved while judging continues on the others.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, we recommend one judgehost per 20 teams.</p>
<p>However, overprovisioning does not hurt: DOMjudge scales easily in the number
of judgehosts, so if hardware is available, by all means use it. But running a
contest with fewer machines will equally work well, only the waiting time for
teams to receive an answer may increase.</p>
<p>Each judgehost should be a dedicated (virtual) machine that performs no other
tasks. For example, although running a judgehost on the same machine as the
domserver is possible, it’s not recommended except for testing purposes.
Judgehosts should also not double as local workstations for jury members.
Having all judgehosts be of uniform hardware configuration helps in creating a
fair, <a class="reference internal" href="judging.html#judging-consistency"><span class="std std-ref">reproducible setup</span></a>; in the ideal case
they are run on the same type of machines that the teams use.</p>
<p>DOMjudge supports running <a class="reference internal" href="config-advanced.html#multiple-judgedaemons"><span class="std std-ref">multiple judgedaemons</span></a>
in parallel on a single judgehost machine. This might be useful on multi-core
machines.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>The judgehost requires Linux cgroup support for memory and swap accounting.
Platforms that do not provide this support (some virtualization environments,
for example WSL 1) will not work with the judgehost. See our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/DOMjudge/domjudge/wiki/Running-DOMjudge-in-WSL">wiki</a> for information about DOMjudge and WSL.</p>

<h2>About the name and logo<a class="headerlink" href="#about-the-name-and-logo" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/DOMjudgelogo.svg"><img alt="DOMjudge logo" class="align-right" src="_images/DOMjudgelogo.svg" width="100px" /></a>
<p>The name of this judging system is inspired by a very important and well known
landmark in the city of Utrecht: the Dom tower.  The logo of the 2004 Dutch
Programming Championships (for which this system was originally developed)
depicts a representation of the Dom in zeros and ones. We based the name and
logo of DOMjudge on that.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Erik van Sebille, the original creator of the logo. The
logo is under a GPL licence, although Erik first suggested a “free as in beer”
licence first: you’re allowed to use it, but you owe Erik a free beer in case
might you encounter him.</p>
